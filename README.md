# combine-multiple-jsons
Combines JSONs that have the same structure and exports them. 

I received a folder with hunderds of json files in them. They have the same JSON structure but for my task, I needed to pull the name of the files and insert them into the JSONs and then combine all of them and export to CSV. The file names for me have date information in them so I needed to use them but you can ignore it. It's a really simple and small script but might be useful for someone, someday.
